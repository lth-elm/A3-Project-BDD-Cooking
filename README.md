## Presentation of Cooking startup <a name="intro"></a>

A website offering ready-made meals. Customers order these meals through an interface (HMI) then the meals are delivered to the customers by a delivery service.

**Innovative part : users interaction**

The customers who order the food can also be the cooks who can suggest the recipes and earn credits (the **cook**) that can be used to purchase their meals.

Each customer can submit their own recipes, which can then be added to the list of recipes offered by Cooking (**CdR** = recipe creator, *cr√©ateur de recette* in French).

## Execution <a name="exe"></a>

No need to enter any credentials in the C# code in order to access the database.
A user with all rights is created at the end of the MySQL script.
The credentials of this user are used to log in.

The first two lines of the MySQL script are for dropping the database and deleting all created users.

Here are two credentials to use to login as a client, anyone can create his own :
* id : Senku | password : keurScience (--> this client is a CdR)
* id : Rick  | password : WeAreTheWD  (--> this client is not a CdR)
